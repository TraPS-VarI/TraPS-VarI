# TraPS-VarI
TraPS VarI is a tool to identify membrane-proximal tyrosine-based sequence motifs YxxQ, where Y is tyrosine, Q is glutamine and x any amino acid. It is a python based module for predicting germline receptor variants of single-pass transmembrane proteins potentially capable of modulating in a genotype-dependent manner, the STAT3 signaling and drug sensititiviy to growth inhibition (Ulaganathan et al, 2015; doi:10.1038/nature16449). The algorithm requires single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping datasets in Variable Call Format 4.0 as input. Additionally, the tool finds for associated membrane proteins, all the matching therapeutic target database and DrugBank records.
